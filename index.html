		    One of the things that interest me the most are UAVs, or drones, as they are commonly known.
		 A UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) is an aircraft without a human pilot. UAVs have many uses such as military,
		 recreational, agricultural, scientific, and more. They are controlled either by a human operator with a remote
		 control or by a computer. Small UAVs mostly use li-po batteries while larger ones rely on airplane engines.
		Currently, quadcopters are the most popular civil UAVs. They have a very limited speed and a very short battery life
		(around 10 minutes of flight time). An idea to improve them is to integrate a wing into the design, in a way that enables
		the copter to hover, but also to fly horizontally (using lift force). This integration will allow it to operate very efficiently,
		travel very quickly, very quietly, very smoothly, and for a longer time.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		I have written an essay about how drones can affect our lives. I will include a link below.

		I also like doing DIY projects, mainly with wood and PVC. I often use scrap wood that comes for free, so the main expense comes from power tools.
		People with more budget can let themselves work with metal and create amazing things, such as the video to the right.
		In that video a famous DIY youtuber, colinfurze, presents his automatic wolverine claws which he made by himself in his shed.

		<p>This is a picture of a new drone that can also fold up and fit in your backpack. It has a range of 4 miles, a 30 minute battery life, can fly at up to 40 mph and all of that for about $1000.
